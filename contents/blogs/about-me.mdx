# About Me
## Who Am I ? Let's Talk

Hi! I'm **Abya**, a software engineer who‚Äôs passionate about building useful and delightful digital experiences.

I specialize in **web development**, focusing on **frontend architecture**, **modern UI/UX**, and **performance optimization**. Over the years, I've worked with a variety of tools and frameworks, but I always prioritize solving real problems with clean and maintainable code.

- Design UI with **Tailwind CSS**, and enhance user experience with **Framer Motion** and **React Spring**
- Manage content and content-driven pages with tools like **Contentlayer** and `.mdx`
- Write reusable components, organize code by domain, and structure apps for scalability
- Create side projects, write case studies, and share insights about web development

### üß† Philosophy

For me, writing code is not just about solving technical problems ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **communicating ideas**, **simplifying complexity**, and **crafting experiences** that feel intuitive and enjoyable. I enjoy projects that challenge both my technical and creative sides.

### üå± Currently Exploring

- Animation workflows with **GSAP** and **motion design**
- Building component libraries and design systems
- Server components and caching strategies in **Next.js App Router**
- Performance tuning and Core Web Vitals

### ‚ú® Fun Facts

- Sometimes I write late at night just because I‚Äôm ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù
- I love documenting things ‚Äî that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre reading this!
